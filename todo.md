Bug reports:
- Numpy functionality for v.>2
- Long import times (check against anaconda import)

- "it would be fab if your pre-made plots had some units (e.g. power spectrum so i don’t have to look and see if norm=True means that things are in the (rms/mean)^2 Hz^-1 scaling)"
- can you make the unbinned PSDs step functions? idk how many people will really care about this but i’m so used to looking at step functions that it’s hard to look at unbinned PSDs any other way. and in this example, i might totally miss the QPO at ~2.5 mHz that is more obvious in the step function plot. ofc a choice, so could be a toggle too!

- Add analytic coherence error bars

Next actions:
- Create methods for multiple light curves

Secondary actions:
- Detection for training convergence, etc.
- Detection for learning rate, iterations
- Method for saving data products
