**STELA (Sampling Time for Even Lightcurve Analysis) Toolkit** is a Python package for interpolating astrophysical light curves using Gaussian Processes in order to compute frequency-domain and standard time domain data products.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at:  
[https://collinlewin.github.io/stela-toolkit/](https://collinlewin.github.io/STELA-Toolkit/)

The documentation includes:
- **Overview** of all features
- **Tutorial notebook** with GP modeling and lag analysis
- **Gaussian Process guide** with detailed Bayesian background
- **Module reference** for all functions and classes

---

## Features

- Gaussian Process interpolation with built-in normality testing and transformations, kernel selection, hyperparameter training
- Frequency-domain products: power and cross spectra, coherence, lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra
- Time-domain lag analysis using ICCF and GP-based cross-correlation
- Simulation of synthetic light curves with custom underlying power spectra and injected lags
- Preprocessing: outlier removal methods, polynomial detrending, trimming, etc.
- Convenient plotting in every class using .plot()

## Installation

In progress.
