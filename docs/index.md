# Welcome to the STELA Toolkit 

The **STELA Toolkit** is a Python package for interpolating astrophysical light curves using Gaussian Processes in order to compute frequency-domain and standard time domain data products.

STELA is designed for:

- Researchers handling irregular, noisy light curve data
- Users who want to generate Fourier-based data products (lag spectra, coherence spectra, power spectra, cross spectra)
- ... or standard time-domain products, like lags with CCF and linear ICCF.

Get started:

- [Overview](overview.md) — What STELA can do and how it works
- [Tutorial](tutorial.ipynb) — Hands-on with GP modeling, interpolation, and lag analysis
- [Gaussian Processes](gaussian_process_intro.md) — Background, intuition, and implementation
- [Module Reference](reference/gaussian_process.md) — Technical docs and API

If you're new to GP modeling, the overview and tutorial are the best places to begin.
